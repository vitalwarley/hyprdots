Configured kitty as Thunar's terminal emulator by creating xfce4/helpers.rc in the dotfiles repo and symlinking it to ~/.config/xfce4/. This enables Thunar's "Open Terminal Here" action to launch kitty on Hyprland.

## [2026-01-13] Diary

**File**: ~/.claude/memory/diary/2026-01-13-session-1.md

Fixed Hyprland 0.53.1 "invalid field" configuration errors after upgrade. Converted window rules and layer rules to new syntax: `windowrulev2` → `windowrule` with `match:` prefixes, `initialTitle` → `initial_title`, and `ignorezero` → `ignore_alpha 0`. Updated both repo config and HyDE system config.
